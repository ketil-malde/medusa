Viroblast service

Viroblast is a BLAST web front end.  The viroblast.sh script
generates the Viroblast data directory (a subdir "db" in the
directory pointed to by the TARGET_DIR variable) by identifying
FASTA-formatted files (protein and nucleotide) in the data
directory (identified by the DATA_DIR variable).
